## ‚ú® Included Tools

* Invoke-BasicADScanner ‚Äî Basic scanner for common Active Directory misconfigurations and weak settings.

* Get-CriticalSecurityEvents ‚Äî Collector & analyzer for important Windows Security events (export to CSV/JSON).

* Invoke-BasicObfuscation ‚Äî Small utility with simple obfuscation techniques (reverse string, Base64, simple wrappers).

## Requirements

* Windows (client or server) with PowerShell. Scripts are compatible with PowerShell 5.1 and later.

* For Active Directory queries: ActiveDirectory PowerShell module (RSAT) available on the host or run on a Domain Controller.

* Run PowerShell as Administrator to access Security logs and certain OS features.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Clone or copy the repository to your analyst machine.

2. Open PowerShell as Administrator.

3. Examples:
'''
### Run AD scanner and save CSV
.\Invoke-BasicADScanner.ps1 -OutputPath .\AD_Audit_Report.csv


### Collect security events for the last 2 days and save JSON
.\Get-CriticalSecurityEvents.ps1 -Days 2 -OutputPath .\events.json


### Load obfuscation function and run interactively
. .\Invoke-BasicObfuscation.ps1
Invoke-BasicObfuscation -Command "Write-Host 'Hello World'"
'''
Tip: Dot-source (. .\script.ps1) scripts when you want to load functions into your current session.

## Features & Notes

* Uses XML-based event parsing for robust, language-independent extraction of fields like TargetUserName, ProcessName, etc.

* Supports .csv and .json export formats.

* For best AD-related coverage, run AD/Directory scripts on a Domain Controller or collect events centrally from DCs.

* Adjust the event ID lists and time windows to match your environment and noise levels.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Legal & Ethical Notice

These tools are provided only for authorized security assessments and legal penetration tests. Do not run them against systems for which you do not have explicit permission ‚Äî unauthorized use is illegal and unethical.

## üìé Suggestions & Next Steps

* Use a dedicated VM or jump box for analysis.

* Centralize outputs to a SIEM or shared storage for triage and reporting.

* Optionally integrate results into CSV/JSON pipelines or convert to ECS/CEF for ingestion.
